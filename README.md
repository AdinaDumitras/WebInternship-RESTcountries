## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as [React](https://reactjs.org). You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page

## Building my project

I made the project using [React]

1. Home page where we list all the countries
2. On the left we have the search form - which works
3. On the right we have the filtering of the countries by region - which does not work (don't make a mistake just because the countries are not filtered)
4. On the card of each country we have a button that "passes" you to another page where you can find additional information about that country.

## How to run the app
Download the zip file using the green button, or clone the repository by running the command git clone + the name of this repository in your terminal. In the same terminal once the command is complete, run `npm install` which will install all the dependencies in the `package.json` file and then run `npm start` which will start your development server on `localhost:3000`. You must have [React] installed in order to run this project.
